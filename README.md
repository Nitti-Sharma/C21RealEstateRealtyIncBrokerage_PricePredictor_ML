# N21RealEstateRealtyIncBrokerage_PricePredictor_ML
  ##RealEstateIndustry has been very  dear to my heart. so I end up making my very first project on a real estate company named N21 Real Estate Realty Inc ( a dummy example) Applying machine learning as well as python concepts  to this project have been an enriching experience. Predicting  right house prices is one of the crucial success metric for any real estate company.  In this project, for predicting house prices  for N21 Real Estate Company, I tried analyzing the problem from collecting housing data( I took a small housing dataset), importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end the real estate company will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features.  I used cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split to accomplish my task.
